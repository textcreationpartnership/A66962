            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN the former <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> concerning the <hi>Guide in Controverſies,</hi> as alſo, in the Beginning and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this preſent, I have endeavoured to perſwade a neceſſicy of <hi>Obedience</hi> to a lawful <hi>Church-Authority</hi> from theſe weighty Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, whereon ſeem to be built the <hi>Unity,</hi> and the <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion. <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Firſt, That, However the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> are a Rule <hi>ſufficient;</hi> yet not, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all capacities, a Rule ſo <hi>clear,</hi> but that the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of them is by ſeveral Parties much diſputed; and that in points of Faith <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be known; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as to theſe, need of ſome other Guide for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Chriſtians in this true Senſe. <hi rend="sup">2</hi> That there is contained in theſe Scriptures a Divine <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and that not Conditional, but <hi>Abſolute,</hi> of <hi>Indefectibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> or not erring in Neceſſaries, made to the <hi>Church-Catholick</hi> of all Ages: To It, not only <hi>Diffuſive,</hi> (ſome or other, Perſons, or Churches, alwaies not to erre in neceſſaries;) but, as a <hi>Guide;</hi> or, to the Guides thereof. 3 Again; That the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> throughout <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The major part;</hi> whether thoſe <hi>preſent</hi> in the Council, and decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters in debate, or thoſe <hi>abſent,</hi> and accepting their Decrees: A regular obedience, in any contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thus aſcending to, and acquieſcing in, the <hi>ſentence</hi> of the moſt <hi>ſupreme</hi> in preſent actual being. That alſo, theſe <hi>ſubordinations</hi> of <hi>Church-Governours</hi> are ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known; and by the learned on all ſides acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that even a <hi>Plebeian,</hi> following this line, though amidſt ſo many <hi>Sects</hi> calling him hither, and thither, and all offering to ſhew him the right way, cannot mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake his true <hi>Guide.</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">5</hi> That, from this <hi>preſent Guide</hi> thus diſcovered, All are to learn, both as to the true <hi>ſenſe</hi> of <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> and, of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> or former <hi>Church-Tradition,</hi> and alſo the <hi>legalneſs</hi> of former <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,</hi> &amp;c. (when any of theſe are controverted and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned,) the <hi>Reſolution</hi> of that, which they ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and adhere to, ſo far as its <hi>Determinations</hi> have preſcribed to their <hi>Faith.</hi> And, the more important any point is, that they are hence the more ſtrictly obliged to the Declarations of this Authority, becauſe here more danger in their miſtake. That here; if we grant an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of this Guide in <hi>Neceſſaries</hi> (which is amply proved) this bindeth its Subjects to an <hi>univerſal</hi> accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of its <hi>Decrees,</hi> leſt, perhaps in ſome <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> their Faith ſhould miſcarry. Or, this Guide ſuppoſed <hi>Fallible,</hi> (which preſuppoſeth in ſuch matters ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity in the <hi>Rule</hi>) yet neither thus, are the bonds of their <hi>obedience</hi> any way relaxed, ſince their own fallibility is much grearer: And if, in following ſuch a learned and prudent Conduct, they are expoſed to ſome <hi>error,</hi> yet ſo, to much more, and more groſs, by following their own. Of the miſchief of which <hi>Self-conduct</hi> the many mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
<pb facs="tcp:60731:3"/>moſt abſurd <hi>Sects,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Socinians,</hi> are a dreadful Example. Who very inquiſitive, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and critical, as to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> yet, by throwing off the yoke of a legal <hi>Church-Authority,</hi> are, by the Divine juſt judgment, delivered up to moſt <hi>Capital,</hi> and <hi>Deſperate</hi> errors, and thoſe running through the whole Body of <hi>Divinity.</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">6</hi> That none, in the reſiſtance of <hi>Authority,</hi> can be ſecured by following his <hi>Conſcience;</hi> (though alwaies obliged to follow it,) when It, <hi>culpably,</hi> miſguiding him; and in the information whereof he hath not uſed neceſſary diligence. <hi rend="sup">7</hi> That, where ſuch a weighty <hi>Church-Authority</hi> (I ſpeak of the moſt <hi>ſupreme,</hi> to which the Churches Subjects may apply themſelves) ſo highly authorized, and recommended to us by our <hi>Lord,</hi> ſways on the one ſide, and only <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Reaſons,</hi> relating to the matter in Agitation, but all theſe ſhort of <hi>certainty,</hi> on the other, here a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and diſintereſſed Judgment cannot but paſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; that it is ſafer to ſubmit to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, than relie on the <hi>ſecond.</hi> And then; ſo often, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>reaſons</hi> and private opinion, and deſerting <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> becomes acting againſt our <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the forſaking our private Reaſon, acting according to it. <hi rend="sup">8</hi> That thus; at leaſt, all thoſe, who have a contrary perſwaſion to Authority, but <hi>ſhort</hi> of <hi>certainty;</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> all <hi>illiterat,</hi> and plebeians, unable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Controverſies; or alſo <hi>learned,</hi> that after exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining them, are left ſtill in ſome doubt, which two ſorts will comprehend the moſt Chriſtians) are engaged, in <hi>Conſcience,</hi> to yield their <hi>aſsent</hi> to the <hi>Deciſions</hi> of this Authority. <hi rend="sup">9</hi> That an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>Demonſtrative</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty indeed, where-ever it is, is exempted from all ſuch obedience to Authority, as ſhall require ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Aſſent:</hi> But, that ſuch a <hi>Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> is very difficultly attained, in matters <hi>Intellectual,</hi> and abſtracted from ſenſe; more difficultly yet, in thoſe <hi>Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Divine;</hi> eſpecially, ſuch Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb facs="tcp:60731:4"/>matters, where <hi>Church Authority, i. e.</hi> ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous a Body of <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> men, diſcern little reaſon for that we pretend Certainty of, and ſo much againſt it, as that they declare the <hi>contrary</hi> for <hi>certain.</hi> To which may be added the frequent experience of our own weakneſs, when, by more ſtudy, and better weight<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing, and comparing <hi>contrary</hi> Reaſons, we come to <hi>doubt</hi> of the truth of ſeveral things, wherein, formerly, we thought our ſelves moſt fully ſatisfied. <hi rend="sup">10</hi> That, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſuch a <hi>Certainty</hi> attained; and ſo obedience of <hi>Aſſent</hi> juſtly repealed; yet, if this be of a <hi>Truth</hi> of no <hi>great importance</hi> or conſequence (of which <hi>great</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance too, as well as of the truth it ſelf, they are to be <hi>certain,</hi>) here ſtill, another <hi>Obedience, viz.</hi> that of <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> or Non-contradiction, tyes us faſt, and reſts ſtill due, and payable to <hi>Church-Authority:</hi> And ſo, theſe <hi>Certainiſts,</hi> or <hi>Demonſtrators,</hi> become, at leaſt, tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, and conſtrained to ſtand <hi>ſingle;</hi> and diſinabled to father, or beget, <hi>Sects.</hi> 
               <hi rend="sup">11</hi> Or, in the laſt place, if this alſo Certain, that it is a <hi>Truth</hi> of <hi>great</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and the <hi>Error</hi> of the Church-Guides therein not only manifeſt, but <hi>Intolerable,</hi> and ſo they here obliged alſo, to break this ſecond obedience, ſilence, and to publiſh ſuch truth: Yet remain they ſtill fettered with the Bonds of a third <hi>Obedience;</hi> I mean <hi>Paſſive,</hi> in a meek ſubmittance to the <hi>Church's Cenſures.</hi> And, if they ſhall happen to be <hi>excommunicated</hi> by the <hi>Church,</hi> and externally disjoyned from its Society, yet is it by no means lawful for them, after their publiſhing <hi>new Doctrines,</hi> to proceed alſo to erect a <hi>new Altar,</hi> or Anti-Communion, againſt it: But, patiently undergoing its ſentence, and longing for their peaceable reſtorement to the former <hi>Catholick</hi> Communion (which is alwaies but <hi>One,</hi> and may not be divided,) they are to expect, from God, the vindication, of his <hi>Truth;</hi> and their <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence:</hi> Which ſo long as any ſuffers for, he remains ſtill <hi>internally</hi> a member of this former <hi>Society,</hi> from
<pb facs="tcp:60731:4"/>which <hi>externally</hi> he is excluded. Now by this third <hi>Obedience,</hi> if the Churches <hi>Faith</hi> in ſome manner ſuffers, yet its <hi>Unity</hi> at leaſt will remain unviolated, and not divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or torn, by Schiſmes. Theſe things I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repreſent, and perſwade to the pious Reader in the former <hi>Diſcourſes;</hi> as alſo, in the beginning and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this preſent Work, have further preſſed them. Now, from ſuch a ſubmiſſion to a <hi>legal</hi> Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity once gained, the ſame is rightly demanded to that of <hi>Trent,</hi> if this <hi>Council</hi> proved <hi>Legal:</hi> And then, by this Council, once received and ſubmitted to, is an end put to the moſt, and chiefeſt, of the <hi>modern</hi> Theological <hi>Controverſies,</hi> and preſent Church-diſtractions. This, then, is the Task of the following Diſcourſe: Of which I implore the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> for a <hi>proſperous</hi> ſucceſs, only ſo far, as it maintains a <hi>right,</hi> and juſt, Cauſe; and ſo commit the <hi>Reader</hi> to the gracious Illuminations of his <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60731:21"/>reſt of the Biſhops of the ſame Province; amongſt whom, for order ſake, there was one Chief; to whom it pertained to call them together; to ſit as Moderator in the midſt of them, being aſſembled; and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute what by joint conſent they reſolved on. The actions of the Biſhops of a Province, and of a Provincial Synod conſiſing of thoſe Biſhops, were ſubject to a Synod conſiſting of the Metropolitans, and other Biſhops of divers Provinces. This Synod was of two ſorts. For either it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Metropolitans, and Biſhops of one Kingdom, and Nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as did the Councils of</hi> Affrica; <hi>or of the Metropolitans, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of many Kingdoms. If of the Metropolitans, and Biſhops of one Kingdom, and State only, the chief Primate was Moderator: If of many, one of the</hi> Patriarchs, <hi>and chief Biſhop of the whole world</hi> [was Moderator]: <hi>every Church being ſubordinate to ſome one of of the</hi> Patriarchal <hi>Churches, and incorporate into the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of it.</hi> Here you ſee that roundly confeſt, which Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> concea'ld, Again, <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 668.— It <hi>is evident, That there is a power in Biſhops, Metropolitans, Primates, and Patriarchs, to call Epiſcopal, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, National and Patriarchal Synods;</hi> [Synods Patriarchal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to Patriarchs: National to Primates] <hi>and that neither ſo depending of, nor ſubject to, the power of Princes; but that, when they are enemies to the Faith, they may exerciſe the ſame without their conſent, and privity, and ſubject them, that refuſe to obey their Summons, to ſuch puniſhments, as the Canons of the Church do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe in caſes of ſuch contempt, or wilful negligence.</hi>—And, <hi>Ib.</hi> p. 557.— <hi>That the Decrees of Popes, made with the conſent, and joint concurrence of the other Weſtern Biſhops, did bind the Weſtern Provinces, that were ſubject to him, as Patriarch of the Weſt.</hi> Bind them ſo, as that theſe had no liberty to <hi>contradict</hi> the judgment of the Patriarch, and this Council: for which ſee <hi>Ib. c.</hi> 39. <hi>p.</hi> 563. where he quotes the Emperors Law, (<hi>Novel.</hi> 123. <hi>c.</hi> 22. —<hi>Patriarcha Dioceſeos illius huic cauſae praebeat finem, nullâ parte ejus ſententiae</hi> contradicere <hi>valente</hi>), confirming the 9th. Canon of <hi>Conc. Chalced.</hi> Again, <hi>p.</hi> 567. 568. he ſaith— <hi>That it is a Rule in Church-government; that the leſſer, and inferior, may not judge the greater, and ſuperior.</hi>— <hi>That, if any Biſhop have ought againſt his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitan, he muſt go (as I ſhewed before) to the Patriarch, and his Synod, to complain; as to fit, and competent Judges.</hi>— <hi>That the great Patriarchs of the Chriſtian Church are to be judged by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their own rank in order before them, aſsiſted by inferior Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops; that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>as firſt in order among the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, aſsiſted with his own Biſhops, and the Biſhops of him, that is thought faulty,</hi> [though theſe later are not found always neceſſary, or preſent at ſuch judgments; nor, more of his own Biſhops,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60731:21"/>than thoſe whom he can at ſuch time conveniently aſſemble, and conſult with, as appears in the Appeals of thoſe perſons named before, §. 13. n. 1.] <hi>may judge any of the other Patriarchs; That ſuch as have complaints againſt them, may fly to him, and the Synod of Biſhops ſubject to him, and that the Patriarchs themſelves, in their diſtreſses, may fly to him, and ſuch Synods, for relief, and help.</hi> (See the ſame,<note place="margin">§. 16. n. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>p</hi> 668) Nor doth he acknowledge ſuch an authority of Judicature in theſe Church Prelates, only as joined w th their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, but alſo in them ſingle, and without them. For, ſince it is manifeſt; that the conſtant meeting of the <hi>Provincial</hi> Synods <hi>twice,</hi> as it was ordered at the firſt, or <hi>once,</hi> in the year, as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, did very early ceaſe, either by the Clergies neglect, or the great trouble, and charge of ſuch Aſſemblies, and ſo later Councils accordingly appointed ſuch Synods to be held in ſtead of twice yearly, once in 3. years (nor yet are in this well obeyed), Hence either all ſuch Cauſes, and Appeals to their Superious (ſtill multiplied, as Chriſtianity is increaſed,) muſt be for ſo long a time ſuſpended, and depending, which would be intolerable; and a quick diſpatch, though leſs equitable, rather to be wiſhed; or, the hearing of them muſt be devolved to theſe ſingle ſtanding Judges, as directed by former Church-Canons. Concerning this therefore thus the ſame Doctor goes on,<note n="‖" place="margin">l. 5. p. 514.</note> quoting the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. and 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.

And, if this rarer meeting of <hi>Provincial</hi> Synods tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred many Cauſes on the <hi>Metropolitans</hi> ſole Judicature, much more did that rarer aſſembling of a <hi>Patriarchal,</hi> or <hi>General,</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, leave appeals in greater Cauſes to the ſingle Arbitrement of

For note here, That whatever Prerogative, or Priviledge, is challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a Chriſtian Prince, as naturally belonging to the <hi>Civil</hi> Power, cannot be denied alſo to an Infidel, or Heathen, Prince, when poſſeſſed of the ſame power; [For example, If a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Prince may lawfully reſtrain the Biſhops, his Subjects, from meeting in Synods, from executing the Church-Canons, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing their definitions in matter of Doctrine, (I mean ſuch as no way concern the State) within his Realm, without his leave, upon this account, becauſe he is the Politick Supreme; ſo may a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,</hi> as having the very ſame Title to do it.] And therefore, none ſuch muſt be haſtily challenged by the one, which, if exerciſed by the other, would both have ruined the Government of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and rendered its ordinary practice guilty of a moſt high Rebellion. If theſe Chriſtian Princes, therefore, now aſſiſt the Church to call her Councils, if they adopt her Canons amongſt their Laws, and uſe their ſecular ſword (much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and dreaded by many, for the preſent, than her Spiritual one) to force their Subjects, and hers, to a more ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to her Laws; we may not therefore argue her former power is now loſt, for calling Councils; or, for executing her Canons, unleſs theſe firſt be made alſo their Laws, becauſe a ſecularly-ſtronger Power is joined with hers, for the more advancing the ſame effect; and hence perhaps, to ſome, may ſeem to eclipſe Hers. But, though, in ſuch a Conjunction, the Princes Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſeems to have the ſtronger influence on Church-affairs; yet, ſo often as any ſuch Prince, in Profeſſion, Chriſtian, but addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome Faction apart, withdraws ſuch aſſiſtance from his true

Elſe, if we ſuppoſe any one Branch of the former Church-Authority, in ſuch a caſe as this, to be loſt by the Princes being Chriſtian; any Heretical Prince will now have the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ruine the Orthodox, and Catholick Religion within his Territories, as a Heathen Prince would then have had, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Chriſtian,</p>

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:60731:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>were aſſembled by the Churche's <hi>ſole</hi> Authority, without the Prince's concurrence, or leave; and, if amongſt theſe Councils, none ſave the firſt, were abſolutely General, yet this was not from a defect of power in the Church to convene ſuch a Council, but that ſhe thought, in ſuch a ſecular oppoſition, her affairs might be, by many divided Councils Provincial more privately, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely diſpatched, as the Controverſie about <hi>Eaſter</hi> was in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Century.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Right</hi> therefore, formerly poſſeſſed by the Church, Princes, by their ſubmitting unto it, and becoming Chriſtian, cannot juſtly take away: nor may be thought to do ſo, by their accumulative power in aſſiſting the Church from time to time for procuring the more effectual concurrence. (which much depends on their temporal penalties), of ſuch great Aſſemblies. But whatever priviledge of <hi>calling</hi> General Councils ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to Princes ſo long as Catholick, yet at leaſt that Right, which in this matter is conceded to belong to the Church, in caſe the Emperor, or Prince, be Infidel, muſt alſo be reſumed in caſe the Prince Chriſtian be an enemy to the Orthodox Faith: (<hi>i. e.</hi>) be either Heretical, or Schiſmatical (of which likewiſe it belongs to the Supreme Governors of the Church to judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) For<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What miſchief may the Church ſuffer from <hi>unbelieving,</hi> that ſhe may not alſo ſuffer from <hi>Heretical,</hi> Princes?

So alſo, if the matter of the faith, oath, or promiſe, be a thing <hi>unlawful</hi> to be done, neither, here, may ſuch faith either lawfully be given; or, given, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. If the <hi>matter be unlawful,</hi> I ſay; either by the <hi>divine</hi> law, if, and though, it be the publick faith given by a <hi>ſuprem</hi> Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: or alſo, by any <hi>humane</hi> law, if it be a faith given by <hi>Inferiors,</hi> and <hi>Subjects</hi> to ſuch laws. Among which unlawful things, and that <hi>jure divino,</hi> is to be numbred, if Faith be given, either by Prince or Subject, in any thing, which invades anothers right, or aſſumes to our ſelves, what only is in anothers lawful diſpoſal; and ſo involves doing wrong to a third perſon, which it is never lawful to do; (though <hi>cedere de noſtro jure</hi> is a thing very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) So, for Example, in the particular matter of <hi>Hereticks.</hi> If the <hi>ſupreme</hi> Temporal Magiſtrate ſhould paſs his <hi>faith</hi> to one ſuſpected of Hereſie, to free him from any <hi>Trial</hi> thereof by the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Tribunal; or to free him, found guilty thereof, from the ſentence of Excommunication, a right belonging to the Church, and independent of ſecular Powers; or to introduce, or continue, him, excommunicated, in the Catholick Church-Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, ſuch faith, as it is unlawfully given, ſo neither, given, can it lawfully be obſerved. Again, when the law of a Prince, or State, reſtrains to <hi>profeſſed Hereticks</hi> the publick Exerciſe of their Religion, or impoſeth ſome mulct upon them, and this law is here ſuppoſed juſt, if a <hi>Subordinate</hi> Officer, or <hi>private</hi> perſon, engage his faith to ſome Hereticks to the contrary, ſuch faith to them is not to be kept, as promiſing a thing not in his, but rather anothers, lawful power, and diſpoſal; And the ſame it were in a

               <p>Mean while, where none of the forenamed caſes happen; where the matter of the pact is no <hi>ſin</hi> (and no ſin it is, that offends againſt no law) nor only <hi>conditional,</hi> Faith given to whomſoever, by what perſon ſoever, is affirmed no way diſpenſable, or remittible, (unleſs the party, to whom it is given, relax it) neither upon the plea of <hi>Fear</hi> in making it (I ſay, no ſuperior law voiding ſuch pacts) nor upon any <hi>damage, temporal,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> coming by it. For ſome ſpiritual damage to be ſuſtained thereby, affords no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to pretend an action unlawful. Since the <hi>damage,</hi> both ſpiritual, and temporal, to the world would be far the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when none, by reaſon of theſe, and the like <hi>Exceptions,</hi> could have any ſecurity of anothers faith: ſince ſuch Pacts, and Oaths, moſt what, are made, from ſome temporal neceſſity conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men thereto, and frequently do infer ſome ſpiritual, or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral damage; or do ſome otherwayes hinder ſome publick, or private good.</p>

And it is clear at firſt ſight; becauſe this clauſe was capable (though.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60731:58"/>contrary to the intention of the Council of <hi>Baſil</hi>) of ſuch a falſe Gloſſe (namely, if it be thus underſtood; that when any Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was produced out of <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Fathers,</hi> the Proteſtants might accept, or reject it, as they judged it to be founded, or not founded in the Scriptures) as would void the ſenſe of the words, that went before it, and make them needleſly added to <hi>[lex divinae.]</hi> the Proteſtants, when any ſuch authority out of Councils or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers is urged, anſwering; <hi>Oſtende, quod illa Conciliae,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raciter fundarunt in Scriptura:</hi> which is the ſame with; <hi>Proba hoc quod Concilium dicit ex Scripturis.</hi> For, ſuppoſe thoſe Councils quote ſome Scriptures for what they ſay, yet will not Proteſtants therefore yield, that what they ſhall ſay is founded there; becauſe they may ſay, they quote them in a wrong ſenſe: and now you may ſee the reaſon of what <hi>Soave</hi> ſaid above, and the great point the Proteſtants had gained, if the Safe-conduct had run in the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Baſil,</hi> though that Form names, with the Scriptures, <hi>Concilia, &amp; Doctores, &amp; praxin Apoſtolicam, &amp; primitivae Eccleſiae,</hi> for the judge of Controverſies. But why is the Tridentine Council ſo averſe, you will ſay, that <hi>Scripture only</hi> ſhould be the Judge, or the ground of their judgment in matters of Religion? For this reaſon; becauſe, when there is controverſie of the <hi>meaning</hi> of Scripture (as moſtly it is) it is fit, the Councils and Fathers ſhould terminate the diſpute therein; or elſe what end can be of ſuch Controverſie, when thoſe, againſt whom the Councils declare, ſhall ſo often ſay, the Councils declare againſt the Scriptures, <hi>i. e.</hi> their ſenſe of them? But here it is ſufficient; that though the Safe-conduct, as to the way, which the Proteſtants demanded, of the trial of their Doctrines, was excepted againſt (of which more by and by) yet, as to the ſecurity of their perſons, it was unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Thus much from §. 82. that no deficiency in the <hi>Summons, place,</hi> or <hi>Safe-conduct,</hi> hath rendred this Council illegal, or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging.</p>

That, if the Biſhops are appointed the ſole Judges of ſuch matters and cauſes, they do not ceaſe to be ſo upon any, either intereſt, or ſiding, which they may be ſhewed to have in the cauſe. And indeed, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, * their former common Tenents, and practiſes in thoſe things, which, upon ſome oppoſition, they meet afterward to judge; * to what ſide of a controverſie the major part of them hath formerly inclined, or alſo declared for it, ſomething of what they judge tending to their <hi>Honour,</hi> another to their <hi>Profit,</hi> another to their <hi>Peace,</hi> in ſome ſence they may almoſt alwaies be ſaid to judge in their own cauſe; or, on their own ſide. So, when ever they are divided into two opinions, or parties, who ever of them judgeth here, and none may judge beſide them, judgeth in his own cauſe. And ſo it is, when any one oppoſeth the <hi>Church</hi> in any of her <hi>Traditions,</hi> or <hi>Doctrines,</hi> formerly owned by her:
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:60731:62"/>For inſtance, when one oppoſeth the <hi>Order of Biſhops;</hi> the juſt <hi>obligation</hi> of the Churches <hi>Decrees;</hi> queſtioneth, * whether the Church-Governours, ſucceeding the Apoſtles, hold ſuch or ſuch their authority <hi>immediatly</hi> from Chriſt, independent on ſecular Princes? * Whether the receiving of Holy <hi>Orders</hi> be neceſſary for <hi>adminiſtring</hi> the Sacraments? * Whether Tithes be due, <hi>jure divino?</hi> In all theſe we muſt ſay, that the Church is appointed by God Judge in her own cauſe. Or if, in ſome of theſe things, not the Clergy, but the <hi>Laity,</hi> be the right Judge; yet ſo we ſtill make him, who judgeth, to judge in his own cauſe, and in a matter, wherein he is intereſſed; whilſt he ſo much againeth in thoſe things; as the other loſeth.

Will the Proteſtant be judged by the Emperour; or the Roman Catholick by the Duke of <hi>Saexony,</hi> becauſe a Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? But if an <hi>equal</hi> number of Laicks, becauſe there alſo are parties, ſhall be choſen on both ſides, whether Princes or others, the ſame accidents recur, as in taking an <hi>equal</hi> number of Clergy.

(So the King, <hi>Ibid.</hi>)—<hi>We muſt find ſome Rule to judge betwixt us, when you and I differ upon the interpretation of the ſelf-ſame Text, or it can never determine our queſtion.</hi> As we ſee amongſt the reformed alſo of thoſe daies, that, the Scriptures being made ſole judge or rule to

And ſo it was in the fourth General Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> Whoſe Decrees, though for other matters, confirm'd; yet its 27th Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, in the preference of the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> before the 2d. Patriatch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> being diſallowed by the <hi>Roman,</hi> and the other <hi>Weſtern</hi> Biſhops, doubtleſs, hence, was of no force, till afterward this was alſo by them conſented to. Neither, if we can ſhew in ſome Council, that the <hi>Prime Patriarch,</hi> preſiding in it, or the <hi>major</hi> part of Church-Governours (who were abſent) have rejected ſome particular Canons thereof, can we, here, plead our ſelves free from obedience for all the reſt (ſee ſuch arguing in Dr <hi>Hammond,</hi> of Hereſie, §. 9. <hi>n.</hi> 6. and §. 11. <hi>n.</hi> 3, 7.) which both he, and the major part of the Church, have allowed, and conform to. For thus, the Eutychian might plead his freedom from any obligation to thoſe Canons of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> that were <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally</hi> agreed on by Eaſt and Weſt, becauſe the 27th.

               <p>Thus, you ſee, I have run through the chief differences;<note place="margin">§. 151. <hi>n.</hi> 1.</note> to add more is eaſie, but needleſs; giving you in the cloſe the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral obſervation of <hi>Soave,</hi> p. 230. <hi>That, which hath been related</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in this particular</hi> [the Controverſie concerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Grace] <hi>and perhaps did happen in many matters</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> the members of the Council to differ in their judgment] <hi>occurred not in condemning the Luther an opinions; where all did agree with an exquiſit unity.</hi> To which words may be added what Archbiſhop <hi>Lawd</hi> confeſſeth, §. 27. <hi>n.</hi> 1.—<hi>That none had ſuffrage in the Council, but ſuch as were profeſſed enemies to all, that called for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> Therefore no Biſhops, that were preſent in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil (for all ſuch had ſuffrages) but were enemies to all, that called for reformation. And, this being ſo, ſurely there needed to be uſed no <hi>tyranny</hi> over ſuch perſons for ſo much as concerned the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> controverſies. What will be ſaid here, I know not. ſhall we pretend, that this unanimity of the Council againſt the Lutheran tenents, roſe out of ignorance of the grounds of their doctrine? But they read their works, and diligently collected out of theſe what doctrines were fit to be condemned; which they could not do, without ſeeing alſo in them the <hi>reaſons</hi> and <hi>foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of ſuch doctrines. Or aroſe it out of fear, which ſome of the Council, well inclined, had of the reſt? The Archbiſhop (§. 29. <hi>n.</hi> 4.) ſeems to ſay ſome ſuch thing.—<hi>For ought</hi> A. C. <hi>knows, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny might agree with the Proteſtants in heart, that in ſuch a Council durſt not open themſelves.</hi> But ſo, in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> for ought we know, many might agree with the Arrians. How can we have any judgment or ſentence from Councils, if we appeale from their mouths to their hearts, inſcrutable by us? But, if the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops <hi>many</hi> were an inconſiderable part of the Council, then ſtill it is confeſt, that the main body of the Council were againſt the Proteſtants; which we were here to demonſtrate: If his <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> were a great and conſiderable part of the Council, ſo as the act of the reſt without them would have been invalid, then why they ſhould ſo fear, as not to open their mouth, I ſee not. Or laſtly aroſe it out of that <hi>fear,</hi> which all the <hi>Council</hi> had of the <hi>Pope?</hi> But then why did they, in matters which more nearly concerned the Pope, ſo freely vote againſt what he, and what his Legats ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, even ſome of the Italians with the reſt?<note n="‖" place="margin">See below §. 153, 168.</note> For if the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:60731:74"/>were twice ſo many Italians as others, a major part of the Council could not vote againſt the Popes inclinations, without ſome of the Italian Biſhops concurring.</p>
               <p>But to diſpel clearly theſe doubts,<note place="margin">§. 151." <hi>n.</hi> 2.</note> you may underſtand, that the Biſhops voted nothing againſt the Proteſtants, in the chief points at leaſt, but what was their own <hi>belief</hi> and <hi>practice</hi> before they came to the Council; and what had been the practiſe and belief of many former ages, even the reformed being Judges: And that the chief <hi>queſtion</hi> to be decided in the Council, was; whether ſuch, and ſuch practices <hi>lawful, viz.</hi> whether <hi>Communion in one kind only: Adoration of Chriſts corporal Preſence in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; offering the ſacrifice of the Maſs; veneration of Images; Prayer to Saints; Prayer for the Dead, as better able, thereby, in their preſent condition before the day of Judgment; Indulgences; Monaſtick Vows; enjoyning Celibacy; enjoyning Sacerdotal Confeſsion, in caſe of mortal ſin,</hi> &amp;c. be <hi>lawful.</hi> And, ſeeing the chief queſtion, in oppoſition to the new Lutheran Doctrines, was; whether theſe things lawful, which were then, and in many former generations (Proteſtants not denying it) daily practiſed, what need, of force, of new Mandats from <hi>Rome,</hi> of hiring Suffrages, creating more, titular, Biſhops, Oaths of ſtrict obedience to the Pope, ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Italians, to procure a prevalent vote, or, to invite the Prelats in the <hi>Council</hi> to eſtabliſh thoſe things, ſeveral of which are found in their <hi>Miſſals</hi> and <hi>Breviaries.</hi> As: <hi>the Sacrifice of the Maſs; Adoration of Chriſts Body and Bloud in the Euchariſt, Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Saints, Prayer for the Dead.</hi>] But yet, if theſe <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Council</hi> decided theſe things in ſuch a manner, by compulſion, how came both the Catholick Biſhops, in the German <hi>Diets,</hi> where free from ſuch <hi>fears,</hi> or <hi>force,</hi> in the time of the Council, to vote the ſame things, and alſo after the Council the many more <hi>abſent</hi> Fathers of the Weſtern Churches (and of <hi>France</hi> with the reſt) ſo freely, and voluntarily, to <hi>accept</hi> them, and to continue till their death in the conſtant obſervance of them.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſaid, that, though ſuch things were generally believ'd, and practiſed before, yet, by Art and violence, were now the Fathers brought to advance them into matters of <hi>Faith;</hi> I ask, concerning many of theſe Points, what <hi>Faith</hi> required, ſave of thoſe Truths, which are neceſſary to render them lawful, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All practice lawful being grounded on ſome ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Propoſition, that muſt be true. Or, if more be required: yet more than this, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of ſuch practiſe, wherein theſe Fathers voluntarily concurr'd, was no way neceſſary for overthrowing the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> contrary <hi>Doctrine.</hi>

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:60731:77"/>to hold the contrary.

But this, whether <hi>previous,</hi> or <hi>final,</hi> Deciſion by the number of <hi>Nations,</hi> how few ſoever the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of ſome of them be, as it is <hi>new,</hi> ſo, 2<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> ſeems very dangerous for raiſing emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and factions between Nations (to the rending of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace) and leaveth not the <hi>Prelats</hi> of every <hi>Nation</hi> ſo much at their own liberty to joyn their vote with aliens; nor permits the ſame ſcope for men of more <hi>ſpirit, learning,</hi> or <hi>judgment,</hi> of whatſoever Nation to guide the reſt. 3<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> It would render the Councils deſerted, and unfrequented, and conſequently the affairs thereof not ſo well diſcuſſed: whilſt <hi>one Repreſentative,</hi> ſent from one Nation will ſuffice; and equal in vote, and authority, an hundred ſent from another; as here, only three Prelats ſent from <hi>England</hi> did. 4, Again, either <hi>all Nations</hi> ſhall be allowed to have an <hi>equal</hi> vote in the Council, or <hi>unequal; if equal;</hi> then, ſince the Biſhops of three or four leſſer Kingdoms, or States, do not equal the Biſhops of one greater; thus a much ſmaller part of the Church may overvote, and conclude the greater; <hi>if unequal,</hi> how ſhall a juſt proportion be preſcribed? 5. Add to this, that the <hi>multitude</hi> in Council of the <hi>Prelats</hi> of ſome Nation more than of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60731:85"/>another, is, without this new device, already remedied; for this being once agreed on, that the decrees of the Prelats preſent in a Council oblige not, unleſs accepted by the <hi>major</hi> part of <hi>Nations,</hi> and by their <hi>Prelats,</hi> that are abſent, the greater number of one Nation in the Council than of another, cannot oblige the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, if more, to the obſervance of their decrees. 6<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. Such an Innovation could not be made in <hi>Trent</hi> without the conſent of the Council; and thoſe Nations, of which the Council moſtly conſiſted, would never have conſented to have the vote of <hi>one,</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Biſhops from ſome other Countries, perhaps much inferior in their natural, or ſpiritual, parts, and their Co-Patriots uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, to counterpoiſe all theirs.</p>
               <p n="7">7.

And we have no reaſon to think, but that this grave Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at <hi>Sardica</hi> weighed the troubles of ſuch Appeales, as well as the Affricans did afterward; or we now: but thought fit to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſmaller inconveniences to avoid greater miſchiefs, namely, in the Intervals of Councils, Schiſms, and Diviſions between Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, and between National, Churches, by the Church her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus ſo many ſupremes terminating all ſpiritual cauſes within themſelves, as there were Provinces, or Countries; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. 5<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> If this Avocation to the ſupreme be now done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Method, ſometimes uſed, of aſcending by degrees through many ſubordinat Courts, this, when ſuch Courts have not a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent power for terminating the Cauſe, ſeems only a ſhortning both of the trouble, and charge.</p>

                  <hi>Non-Reſidence.</hi> In Seſſ. 23. c. 1.—And,—Seſſ 6. c. 1, 2. 1ſt. It is declared by the Council: That neither Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor inferior Clergy, enjoying any Benefice with <hi>Cura ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum,</hi> may be abſent from their charge at any time, without a juſt cauſe; and, that, by their long, and cauſleſs abſence, they incur <hi>mortal ſin.</hi> 2ly, As to Biſhops; for the abſence of two months, or at the moſt, three in the year, the Council leaves the Examen of this juſt cauſe of ſuch abſence to their conſcience, <hi>Quam ſperat, religioſam, &amp; timoratam fore; cum Deo corda pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, cujus opus non fraudulenter agere, ſuo periculo tenetur;</hi> yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them eſpecially to forbear this abſence, as to <hi>Advent, Lent, the Feaſts of the Nativity, and Reſurrection, Pentecoſt, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Chriſti.</hi> 3ly But then, ordered; That none, whether Biſhop, or alſo Cardinal, exceed ſuch time of two or three moneths in the year, except upon a cauſe allowed, under their hand, by the Pope, or the Metropolitan; or, for the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans abſence, by the Senior Reſident-Biſhop of the Province; the Provincial Council being impowred to ſee to, that there be no abuſes committed in ſuch licences; and that the due penalties be executed on the faulty. 4ly. As for <hi>Prieſts</hi> having <hi>cure;</hi> the Biſhop may prohibit their abſence for any time, exceeding two or three dayes, unleſs they have a licence under his hand for it, upon ſome cauſe approved: Nor yet is ſuch licence for <hi>juſt cauſe</hi> to be granted them, for above two moneths, unleſs this be very preſſing, —<hi>Diſcedendi autem licentiam, ultra bimeſtre tempus, niſi ex gravi cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſâ, non obtineant.</hi> 5ly. Among <hi>juſt Cauſes</hi> of abſence, as the Congregation of Cardinals hath interpreted the Council, ſuch as theſe are not allowed; * want of a Houſe; * a Suit in Law about the living; * a perpetual ſickneſs; or if it not ſuch, as that, for the Cure thereof, either Medicines, or a Phyſitian, is wanting in the place of Reſidence; upon which, abſence may be conceded for three or four moneths, if neceſſiity require ſo much; * An unhealthful
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60731:110"/>aire of the place, to one bred elſewhere; unleſs this aire ſuch only for ſome certain time; * abſence deſired for ſtudy; for a ſufficiency of learning is ſuppoſed to be found, by the Examiners, in ſuch perſons, when elected: * Their being Officials of the Pope, or imployed in ſome ſervice of the Biſhop, or Cathedral Church; unleſs it be their aſſiſtance of him in the Viſitation; * The living at a diſtance three or four miles off, and viſiting his Church, every Lords day. Theſe, I ſay, and ſome others are held no juſt cauſes, for which Reſidence may be diſpenſed with. 6ly, Where ſuch Reſidence is, for a time, juſtly diſpenſed with, the Biſhop is to take care, that, in ſuch abſence, an able Vicar be ſubſtituted with a ſufficient allowance out of the Profits, by the Biſhops arbitration. 7ly, The Penalty of abſence, that is not thus allowed, is Sequeſtration of Profits for time of abſence: to be applied, by the Eccleſiaſtical Superior, to pious uſes; Or, in ſuch abſence continued above a year, and further contumacy ſhewed, when admoniſhed thereof, ejectment out of ſuch Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, or Living; The former to be done by the Pope, whom the Metropolitan, or Senior Biſhop-Reſident, is obliged to inform thereof by Letter, or Meſſenger, within three moneths; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the Ordinary. 8ly, All former Exemptions, or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, for non-reſidence, abrogated.

               <p>The ſecond is: That, at leaſt, none are obliged to obey the Definitions, or Judgment, of a legal Church-Authority, where ſuch are, not only <hi>perſwaded</hi> in <hi>conſcience,</hi> but <hi>demonſtratively cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> (as ſome affirm they are) of the contrary to its Definition; and that, therein, it manifeſtly erreth.</p>

That, where Conſcience, or Judgment (for theſe are both one) propoſeth any thing for truth, yet not without ſome <hi>doubt,</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> of the contrary, here the Will, or the Perſon, ought to ſuſpend action, and put the Judgment firſt on a further ſearch. 2ly That, where ſuch <hi>ſear</hi> is not, the Judgment (erring, or not erring) is indeed to be obeyed: becauſe the perſon alwaies ſuppoſeth this, not to erre, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what is right, ſince he hath no way to know when it erres, but by it ſelf: And it alſo can never erre <hi>knowingly,</hi> or <hi>willingly.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Yet: That in the action, wherein he followeth it when er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, he may much offend God; and this more or leſs, according to the quality of the error, namely, where the Judgment, or Conſcience, doth not invincibly, but culpably, erre; and hath means of being better informed, and ſo of diſcovering its error. So the Jews, when killing our Lord and his Apoſtles, moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offended God, in following an erroneous Judgment, or Conſcience dictating to them, that they <hi>did God good ſervice</hi> herein. And indeed it is a great art of the Devil, as much as he can, to put out the eye of the Judgment, to make men act more reſolutely, where Conſcience leads them on; he finding, that the zeal of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance doth him far more ſervice, than a timorous hypocriſie, and diſſembling againſt Conſcience, could ever do.</p>

And with this care of well-informing the Judgment or Conſcience, it is the <hi>Will,</hi> that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted; though the underſtanding doth the work.

Yet, as for other propoſitions, the truth of which is not diſcerned from any ſelf-evidence, but learn't by proofs and arguments drawn from ſome other things better known, here the truth of ſuch propoſition cannot be attained, but by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and application of the intellect to the ſtudy, and diſcovery of ſuch proofs; and again, ſuch application of the intellect to one thing, or another, for a little, or a long time, depends wholy on the Will.

In oppoſition to the firſt of them, mentioned before, §. 274 [keeping the judgment in ignorance as to Divine matters, and imploying it wholy about other ſtudies] That, ſince a right perſwaſion in Religion is of ſo great conſequence to ſalvation, All thoſe, who are not ſettled, in their Belief, upon the Baſis of Church Authority, and ſo, under it remain in a ſufficient ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Faith, as to all thoſe points, wherein the ſenſe of the Holy Scriptures is diſputed, and controverted by ſeveral parties (as for example, in theſe: Whether Juſtification is by Faith alone? Whether there be Evangelical Councils as well as Precepts? Whether Chriſt our Lord be Co-Eſſential with God the Father? Whether exhibiting his Corporal Preſence in the Euchariſt? Whether there be a Purgatory after this life for ſome imperfect ſouls, though departing in God's Grace? or the like;) All ſuch, I ſay, ſince they have taken the guidance of themſelves, in Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, into their own hands, have great reaſon themſelves to fall, moſt attentively, to the ſtudy thereof.

He ought alſo to weigh not only the immediat ſence of Scripture, but the neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; and, ſince whatever things are not oppoſit to Scripture, are truly lawful, and practicable, to diſcern the true, and not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, repugnances thereto; He ought alſo to examin Tranſlations, peruſe the Comments, and Expoſitions of others, Modern, Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: For all theſe things that <hi>Authority</hi> moſt exquiſitly doth, whoſe judgment and conduct he declines.

Next, as to the Second, mentioned before, § 275.

               <p>And, upon this, ſuch Judgment, alſo will conſider; That, ſince our firſt perſwaſions, in Religion, and the particular ſect thereof wherein we live, are not taken up upon our own choice, but anothers; who, having ſome command over us, anticipate our judgment, and educate us in what opinions they pleaſe; hence it is, that our conſtancy and perſeverance, even ſometimes to the loſs of Eſtate, and Life, to whatever we thus caſually firſt light on (called by the name of <hi>Fidelity</hi> and love of <hi>Truth;</hi> and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>perfidiouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtacy</hi>) is indeed, before we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined things better, only a raſh, and inconſiderat <hi>Obſtinacy;</hi> and that on the contrary, in prudence, every one ought to put himſelf in a great indifferency to change thoſe firſt principles he is thus ſeaſoned and poſſeſſed with, as he ſhall, by new experience, find cauſe; and to eſteem that only <hi>Conſtancy</hi> in his <hi>Religion, i. e.</hi> in his true ſerving of God, to alter every day, and that through a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Secular obſtacles, to any thing, wherein he conceives, he may ſerve him better. As in our manners, when any way deficient, we do this, without reproach.</p>
               <p>Yet further will conſider, ſince (as hath been ſhewed) there is but one Communion of all thoſe various Sects, in which, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly, the Education of Chriſtian Youth happens to be moulded, namely that which adheres to the <hi>Supreme Church-Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> that is <hi>Catholick,</hi> and truly diſingaged of <hi>Schiſm;</hi> That all thoſe, who find themſelves to live under ſuch <hi>Superiors,</hi> as are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and ſtand divided, from <hi>their</hi> Superiors, and condemned by them, ought to entertain a great jealouſie of their preſent ſtate, and not acquieſce in any ſuch Government, at adventure; but preſently to reduce their ſubjection to that Authority that is eſtabliſhed by our Lord. Again, in the next place, that ſuch a one ought to improve, or to check, in himſelf, theſe ſuggeſtions of a <hi>change,</hi> as the Religion he deliberates on, is more licentious, or more ſtrict in compariſon of that, which for the preſent he
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:60731:134"/>profeſſeth. For ſtrong inclinations to change to a Religion that is more rigorous, and mortifying his luſts, that requires much Obedience, Reſignation, and Humility from him, that captivates his underſtanding as well as curbs his appetites, things nature much relucts againſt, we may preſume to proceed from the Spirit of God: But, if to a Religion, that promiſeth him in many things more liberty; to proceed from his luſts.</p>
               <p>And, ſuch a happy diſcovery being made by him, ſuch a freed Judgment will proceed to conſider; That, if yet further, by reaſon of the perſecution of ſuch a Religion, in the place where he lives, ſuch a Convert hath an occaſion alſo offered him of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Father, or Mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Friends, or Fortunes, and, among the reſt, not the leaſt, his Reputation, and good Name, in being eſteemed a <hi>Turncoat,</hi> an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> a Seducer; to imbrace, again, in the Religion he turns to, nothing but Croſſes, and Faſtings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Penances, Reſignation of Judgment, ſtrict obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Churches, as well as Gods, Laws, and many more hardſhips, ſet before him, if he purpoſeth to arrive at perfection; ſuch a true inlightened Judgment, I ſay, will here conſider: that this is one of the greateſt Honours, that his Divine Majeſty could do him upon earth; and a happineſs next to Martyrdom. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will conſider, that the wiſdom of God hath permitted ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Sects</hi> and Factions, divided from the true Church, and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Schiſms to their children, to exerciſe the diligence of ſuch, as have the hap to be ſo miſ-educated, to find out that holy Communion, of which he hath left ſufficient teſtimony, and, after this, to practice their Chriſtian Courage and Reſolution, to own and repair to it.</p>

And, though, in this caſe, the Church might remain a Church (and ſo the deſtructive gates of hell not prevail againſt it) and ſtill retain all parts of the Apoſtles</hi> Depoſitum <hi>in the hearts of ſome faithful Chriſtians, which had no power in the Council to oppoſe the Decree, or, out of it, to reſiſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,

And ſo again, when Hereſies came into the Church in the firſt ages, 'tis every where apparent by</hi> Ignatius <hi>his Epiſtles, that the only way of avoiding error and danger, was to adhere to the Biſhop in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and doctrine; and whoſoever departed from him, and that form of wholſome words kept by him, was ſuppoſed to be corrupted,</hi> &amp;c. And in his <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> chap. 2. §. 10. he ſpeaks in this manner,—<hi>A meek Son of the Church of Chriſt will certainly be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to ſacrifice a great deal for the making of this purchaſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>of enjoying the Churches communion; and when the fundamentals of the faith, and ſuperſtructures of Chriſtian practice are not concerned in the conceſsions, he will chearfully expreſs his readineſs to ſubmit, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite his own judgment in reverence and deference to his Superiors in the Church, where his lot is fallen.</hi> [Methinks he might better have

Both our diſobedience</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> diſſent, or non-ſubmiſſion of judgment] <hi>to the one, and diſlike of the other, are unwarrantable, unleſs we can truly derive them from ſome formal contradiction or oppoſition between the publick or general injunction of Superiors, and expreſs law of the moſt High.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And. <hi>c.</hi> 4. p. 165.—<hi>Sundry</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in profeſsion Proteſtants, in eagerneſs of oppoſition to the Papiſts, affirm; that the Church, or ſpiritual Paſtors muſt then only be believed, then only be obeyed, when they give ſentence according to the evident and expreſs law of God made evidens to the heart, and conſciences of ſuch, as muſt believe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60731:137"/>and obey them. And this, in one word, is to take away all authority of ſpiritual Paſtors; and to deprive them of all obedience, unto whom doubtleſs God, by his word, hath given ſome ſpecial authority and right to exact ſome peculiar obedience of their Flock. Now if the Paſtor be then only to be obeyed, when he brings evident commiſsion out of the Scripture for thoſe particulars, unto which he demands belief or obedience, what obedience do men perform unto him more, than to any other man whatſoever? For whoſoever he be, that can ſhew us the expreſs undoubted command of God, it muſt be obeyed of all, But whilſt it is thus obeyed, it only; not he, that ſheweth it unto us, is obeyed. And if this were all the obedience, that I owe unto others, I were no more bound to believe or obey any other man, than he is bound to obey, or believe me: The Flock no more bound to obey the Paſtors, than the Paſtors, them. Yet certainly God, who hath ſet Kingdoms in order, is not the Author of ſuch confuſion in the ſpiritual regiment of his Church.</hi> Thus Doctor <hi>Jackſon</hi> tying all to obedience or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the judgment of their ſpiritual Guides, ſave only thoſe who are certain of a <hi>formal contradiction</hi> between God's Laws, and their Injunctions.</p>
               <p>To this may be added that much noted place of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy,</hi>

Again, to the Fourth:—<hi>That many Points of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Doctrine are the opinions of Hereticks, condemned by the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church</hi> He anſwers, not, by denying the Proteſtant Doctrines to be condemned as Heretical, by the Primitive Church; But, that thoſe in the Primitive Church condemned many doctrines as ſuch; that were not ſo. To the Sixth, —<hi>That the Doctaine of the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>is conformable, and the doctrine of Proteſtants contrary, to the doctrine of the Fathers, who lived in the firſt</hi> 600 <hi>years, even by the confeſsion of Proteſtants themſelves.</hi> He Anſwers, not by denying this; but by retortion of the like to the Roman Church:—<hi>That the Doctrine of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts is confeſt by the Papiſts, contrary to the Fathers, in many points.</hi> But here he tells not, in what points. And had he, I ſuppoſe it would either have been in ſome points not controverted with Proteſtants; As perhaps about the <hi>Millenium: communicating of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> or the like; or elſe, in ſome circumſtances, only of ſome point controverted. To the Tenth,—<hi>That Proteſtants, by denying all humane Authority either of Pope or Councils, or Church, to determine controverſies of Faith, have aboliſhed all poſsible means of ſuppreſsing Hereſie, or reſtoring unity to the Church:</hi> He anſwers, not, by denying Proteſtants to reject all humane Authority, Pope, Councils, or Church: But by maintaining, that Proteſtants, in having the Scriptures only, and indeavouring to believe them in the true ſence, have no need of any ſuch authority for deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining matters of Faith; nor, can be Hereticks; and do take the only way for reſtoring unity. In all which, you ſee Church-authority and ancient Tradition led on the man to be Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick; and the rejecting this authority, and betaking himſelf to a private interpretation and underſtanding of the Scriptures, and indeavouring to believe them in their true ſence, reduced him to Proteſtantiſm.

But on theſe terms, if they would well conſider it, our Lords promiſes to the Church, that it ſhould be ſo firmly built to the Rock, as that the Gates of Hell ſhould never prevail againſt it, and the Apoſtles Prediction, that it ſhould alwaies be a Pillar and ground of Truth, are utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and have miſcarried, in its very infancy.

That ſuch a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> of his <hi>Certainty,</hi> as, propoſed to any that underſtands the terms, ſatisfieth and convinceth him, is good. But, theſe granted, yet a Judgment, well purged from Secular Intereſt, will here alſo conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it is no ſuch eaſie matter, as it is thought, to arrive at <hi>certainty</hi> in things intellectual, where our ſences do not aſſiſt us; and eſpecially thoſe, that are Divine, and Spiritual; * where, theſe things not being collected by Reaſon, but originally deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by Divine Revelation, both the matters are, many times, very <hi>myſterious,</hi> treating of the perfections, wiſdom, and waies, of God: His Divine Laws, and Sacraments; things above our <hi>natural</hi> reach; and the words alſo, ſignifying theſe to us, are many times not free from <hi>ſeveral acceptions,</hi> literal, and figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (elſe all perſons would agree in the ſame ſence) ſo that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent contradiction in the words, by diſtinguiſhing of ſome term, is none in the ſence, but both the verbal Contradictories very true; * Where again, theſe Revelations being many, and all moſt certainly true, none may be taken in ſuch a ſence, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>any</hi> other; And laſtly, * where, the true <hi>eſsence</hi> of things, abſtracted from all their <hi>Accidents</hi> (which accidents again cannot be known to us to be ſo, but by an <hi>actual ſeparation</hi>) being not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known to us, hence alſo though it be moſt certain to us that two contradictories cannot be true, yet is it moſt difficult to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, what things truly contradict. For it is a Contradiction only, when the ſame thing is denied of, or removed from, its felf. As
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60731:149"/>this [a man is not a man.] Or this [A man is white, and not white] where the formal Contradiction, being reſolv'd, is [white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is not whiteneſs: Manhood is not Manhood.] And it is no contradiction, but truth, when ever a thing is denied of any thing not it ſelf. Therefore this, what is, or is not, the thing it ſelf; or, its eſſence; muſt exactly be known, before a true and reall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction be ſo.

To which they apply the compariſon of the nouriſhment, which is made our own Body by Aſsimilation, and Augmentation</hi> Again, <hi>p.</hi> 237. more briefly — <hi>The Doctrine of the Greek Church is: That the ſubſtance of Bread, conſerving its proper Being, is added to the Natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that it is rendred like unto it: That it augments, and by this means becomes the ſame Body with, it. By this alſo</hi> (he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 334. and ſee the ſame in his 4 <hi>l. c.</hi> 7.) <hi>the Greeks would obſerve in ſome ſort the literal ſence of the words,</hi> Hoc eſt Corpus meum, <hi>which</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>we do not; we underſtand them in this ſence: This Bread is the ſacred ſign, or Sacrament of my Body.

               <p>This of the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> thing, wherein M. <hi>Claude</hi>'s explication is deficient; the change the Greeks held of the Bread, into the Subſtance of our Lords Body, at leaſt ſo far, as our Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, into the Subſtanct of ours, the principal reaſon of their uſing this ſimilitude; Yet, wherein M. <hi>Claude</hi> deſerts it, though, in ſome other things, more advantagious to him, (as in the matter of the nouriſhment ſtill remaining, and that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merically diſtinct from the Body nouriſhed,) he preſſeth it too far. Now this 2<hi rend="sup">d.</hi> thing, [the Bread in the Euchariſt its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ſuch a change, as our Nouriſhment,] once granted, will be at leaſt an half-Tranſubſtantiation of it; the Subſtantis Form of Bread being gone; the former Qualities of Bread gone, <hi>viz.</hi> from their any longer inherence in the Bread; So that the Subſtance, not of Bread, but of Fleſh, is alſo under the former Accidents of the Bread; The name alſo gone with the thing; it being in truth now no more to be called <hi>Bread,</hi> but <hi>the Fleſh</hi> of our Lord. And ſo, when the Bread is ſaid by S. <hi>Damaſcen.</hi> to be united to the Divinity, it muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo, as that, in the Union, it becomes another thing; though ſtill it remains a <hi>diverſe</hi> thing from the Divinity. Hence alſo the pretence of the Bread its being made our Lords body only in <hi>Vertue,</hi> not in <hi>Subſtance,</hi> gone; and all M. <hi>Claud</hi>'s queſt after this word <hi>Vertue</hi> in the Greek Authors uſeleſs, and his Deſcants upon it unſound: of which enough hath been ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, §. 321. n. 8.</p>
               <p>The 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.

<pb n="304" facs="tcp:60731:162"/>in the Holy Fuchariſt to ſtand fingular, and unparallel'd by any work of Nature.</p>
               <p>All theſe three therefore the Author, in dealing ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with the Greek's compariſon, and their expreſſions, as it ſeems to me, ought to have allowed. But this, probably, he much dreaded; as ſeeing he might as well, nay in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects better, have admitted a total Tranſubſtantiation of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as well as Form; which would have avoided thoſe many prejudices and indignities, which an <hi>Impanation</hi> labours under.

               <p>Thus far the <hi>Greeks</hi> uſual <hi>ſimile</hi> carries us.<note place="margin">§. 321. n. 16.</note> But their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Doctrine farther, even to a <hi>Total Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> as I think will appear from what follows.</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="1">1.

                  </gap>; nor yet ſufficient, that <hi>all</hi> the ſame things may be ſaid of them both. Some <hi>general</hi> things indeed may be predicated of them, wherein both agree; but their Properries <hi>individual,</hi> as <hi>local preſince, Motion,</hi> any <hi>particular</hi> Qualities or applications
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:60731:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>them cannot: (Yet which <hi>Individual</hi> properties are uſually applyed by the Greeks to the Body Crucifyed, and to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed in the Euchariſt, as one, and the ſame.) Any Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Properties of the one or the other, I grant, may alwayes be truly demonſtrated of our Lords <hi>Body</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> as we will; But cannot be truly ſaid of both, or either of <hi>theſe,</hi> the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated,</hi> and the <hi>Crucifyed,</hi> as we pleaſe, if theſe not numerically the ſame. So we cannot ſay, That ones Soul is his Body; or a Leg, an Arm; or, the one in the ſame place, or motion, or every way affected, as the other is, becauſe that both are parts of one and the ſame Perſon, or Body, and both animated with one and the ſame Soul. And, for a Grecian Prieſt to tell his Communicants, that he delivers them the ſame Body that was Crucifyed and offered for their Salvation, and Redemption (when he gives them neither it, nor any part of it,) becauſe he gives them another Augmentative Breaden part, belonging to the ſame Perſon, which Perſon indeed was Crucifyed for them, ſeems too bold an Equivocation to be, by this Perſon, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently impoſed on the Greek Church, and their ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions. The <hi>Truth</hi> therefore of that, which the Greeks, or other Latines, embracing their Opinion, do affirm; <hi>viz.</hi> that the Euchariſts, Conſecrated in never ſo many places, are all the ſelf-ſame Body, one with another; and all with the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed; becauſe repleniſhed every where with the ſame <hi>Divinity,</hi> muſt be underſtood to proceed, not from the meer Union, or Conjunction, how intimate ſoever, of theſe two (as is ſhewed but now:) but to proceed from the effect (as M. <hi>Claude,</hi> preſſed with his Adverſaries Arguments, confeſſeth<note n="†" place="margin">

And, his Body may be ſaid in ſome ſort to receive daily an <hi>Augmentation</hi> from theſe iterated Conſecrations of Bread to be made his Body, in as much as there is a daily <hi>multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of his Body, as to its local Exiſtence in more places than before, according to the frequency of Communions; whilſt his Body, in Heaven, doth not deſcend, but keeps its conſtant for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reſidence there.</p>
               <p>Thus Greeks and Latines, ormer and latter times,<note place="margin">§. 321. n. 20.</note> will be at ſome accord. Whereas this Author, to maintain a variance between the two Churches, ſeems neceſſitated to faſten on the Greeks an Opinion, which being taken in its juſt extent, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ubſtantiation ſeems much the more eligible; and which he is forced many times alſo to pare, and qualifie ſo, that it may have ſome Conformity to the Doctrine of Proteſtants, and keep a greater diſtance from the Roman, as offers extreme violence to the natural ſence of their words. For Example. He allows, * an Union of the Divinity to our Lords Body in the Euchariſt, as the Greeks ſay; But no ſuch Vnion <hi>Hypoſtatical.</hi> * Chriſt;s body in the Euchariſt the ſame with that born of the Bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, as they ſay; but in ſuch a ſence as mean-while to remain <hi>really, eſſentially, numerically,</hi> diverſe from it. * The Bread, the ſame body with that born of the Virgin; but, It not changed into Chriſts Fleſh, but remaining ſtill <hi>Bread.</hi> * Bread ſtill, not only for the matter; as it was in our Lords, or is in our, nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment; but, for the ſame Subſtantial Form, and Qualities, ſtill inhering in it, as before. * The Bread made the <hi>very,</hi> and true, body, as they ſay; But <hi>virtually</hi> only, in having infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and inherent, in it, the viviſicating virtue of Chriſts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body; (Where the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> leave the <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſtand by themſelves; allowing this Vertue communicated to the <hi>Believeer</hi> only, not to the <hi>Symbols.</hi>) * The Euchariſtical body conjoyn'd (as our nouriſhment is to ours,) to Chriſts natural body, as they ſay, but the one only in <hi>Heaven,</hi> the other on <hi>Earth.</hi> * Our
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:60731:165" rendition="simple:additions"/>Lords Body in the Euchariſt, by the ſame Divinity inhabiting in both, made one and the ſame with that born of the Virgin, as they ſay; but <hi>Myſtically</hi> and <hi>Sacramentally</hi> only. For the ſame Divinity, repleniſhing both, doth not, therefore, render them really the ſame one with another. * The ſame Body this, with that; but no Sovereign Adoration due, or by the Greeks given, to this, as to that. * This the ſame body with that; and this alſo, as indiviſible, received entire by every Communicant, as the Greeks ſay; But this Body entire, in vertue only, not in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. * The ſame Body of our Lord in all places, where this Sacrament is celebrated; But only in the former ſence; <hi>i. e.</hi> the vertue and the efficacie of it, the ſame. If ſuch be their ſence, the Reader cannot but think the Greeks very unfortunate in their Expreſſions; or, if not their ſence, this perſon preſuming, he ſhould meet with very credulous Readers.

               <p n="5">5<hi rend="sup">ly.</hi> But, now, to conſider their <hi>Practice.</hi> He denies not the Greeks to adore, in their Mode of Adoration, (which is by inclining the <hi>Head</hi> and Body; ſeldom, <hi>kneeling,</hi>) when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Communion; their Liturgies have it, often repeated; and, ſurely, he will allow them, herein, as much Devotion as he doth to the Proteſtants: and alſo them, to give at leaſt an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Relative</hi> Devotion to the <hi>Myſteries,</hi> for ſuch they give to the <hi>Evangiles:</hi> and, methinks, the witneſſes he produceth. <hi>p.</hi> 216. ſhould not, in general, denie ſimply, any Adoration of the Greeks at all. The Queſtion, then, only is; granting already an external Adoration given by the Greeks, when they approach to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; whether this, in their intention, be a <hi>ſoveraign</hi> Adoration exhibited to Chriſts Sacred <hi>Divinity</hi> &amp; <hi>Humanity,</hi> as there preſent, Now; the Greek's holding this Humanity there really preſent, conceded before, ſeems ſufficient to determine this, without
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:60731:166" rendition="simple:additions"/>more ado. And, for one to pretend, that this Adoration of the Greeks is given only to God; or to Chriſts <hi>Divinity</hi> as every where preſent; or, to the <hi>Humanity</hi> united to it, but only this as in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and, not to it alſo as preſent in the Euchariſt, when the ſame Greeks confeſs it to be ſo; and, when the Euchariſtical preſence is the occaſion of ſuch their Adoration; here I ſay, not to allow the extent of their Adoration, ſo far as they believe the preſence of the Perſon adored; and their worſhip the ſame latitude, as their Faith, would be an unjuſt and groundleſs abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Devotions: as alſo this, to pretend an <hi>interior,</hi> or <hi>relative.</hi> Adoration given by them only to the Myſteries, where the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants hold a <hi>ſupreme</hi> due to the <hi>Perſon</hi> Preſent with them.</p>
               <p>To view a little the Form of their Liturgy.

That every plain, and ſimple Proteſtant, 1ſt. thinks his <hi>Expoſition</hi> or <hi>ſence</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> in this Point of the Euchariſt, and ſo in others, any way neceſſary, to be <hi>clear,</hi> and without diſpute, <hi>[and the more ſimple he is, the ſooner he may think ſo; becauſe he is not able to compare all other Texes, nor to examine the contrary ſences given by others, or the reaſonable grounds thereof,]</hi> 2. Next, that every one, who thinks his Expoſition, or Sence of Scripture clear in ſuch Point, is by this ſufficiently <hi>aſſured,</hi> that he hath a <hi>right</hi> Faith; or, from this <hi>ſence</hi> of his, knows <hi>what he ought to believe, and forms a Judgement</hi> herein <hi>as certain, as if one had diſcuſsed all the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, one after another:</hi> [a ſtrange propoſition; but <hi>I</hi> ſee nothing elſe, from which ſuch perſon collects his faith to be right; if any doth, produceit] 3ly. That every ſuch ſimple perſon now eaſily knows, whether the Society, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he lives, be a true Church, or otherwiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as they agree with, or diſſent from, that <hi>right Faith</hi> of his already ſuppoſed; or as he finds them <hi>to teach the things clearly contained in God's word, i. e.</hi> in his clear Sence thereof. 4ly. Knowing thus, from this his clear expoſition, or ſence of Scripture, what he ought to believe, he needs not trouble himſelf, what the Ancient Church hath believed; <hi>[which is very true:]</hi> nay, he knows, without reading them, or M. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s and <hi>Claud</hi>'s diſcourſes upon them, that the Fathers, if of the number of the Faithful, were of his Opinion, by M. <hi>Claud</hi>'s arguing foremen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tioned. I deſire the Reader to review his words, or, the 5th &amp; 6th Chapters
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:60731:170"/>of his 1ſt. Book, and ſee if he can make any better conſtruction of them. Now, if there be any Sence in this, he ſaith; How can he hinder, but that a ſimple Catholick way uſe the ſelf-ſame Plea (Church-authority being laid aſide) for a certainty of his Faith upon the ſame pretenſions, <hi>viz. his clear ſence</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> quite contrary to the Proteſtants— clear ſence? And, in any Controverſie amongſt Proteſtants: (Suppoſe that of the Remonſtrants and Anti-Remonſtrants,) here both ſides have the ſame Plea, one againſt another; namely, the certainty of their Faith from their own Sence of the Scriptures controverted between them. And, why doth not this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty void their Synods. For M. <hi>Claude</hi> ſaith,—<hi>The word of God contains nettement &amp; clairement, all that which is neceſſary to form our Faith, and that the moſt ſimple are capable to judge of it,</hi> &amp;c. Unleſs the Proteſtant Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies be never about any thing <hi>neceſſary.</hi> This is the way M. <hi>Claude</hi> thought on to leave no <hi>Doubters,</hi> though never ſo unlearned, among Proteſtants as to the Euchariſt, or other Points of their Faith. But mean while, if, after ſuch Speculations of his, any ſuch <hi>Doubters</hi> there be, I do not find, but that he leaves ſo many wholly to D. <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s diſpoſal, <hi>viz.</hi> that they return to, and remain in, the boſom of the former Church ſo long, till they become certain of its errors; and not follow ſtrangers that have not entered by the dore, into Chriſt's Fold; and, I hope, they will conſider it. As for the <hi>ſettling</hi> of our <hi>Conſcience</hi> this perſon ſpeaks of, by reſting our <hi>Faith immediately</hi> on <hi>Gods Word,</hi> I ſee not, where the <hi>ſence</hi> of the Scriptures is ſuppoſed the thing <hi>controverted,</hi> how any one reſts his Faith more immediately on <hi>God's word</hi> by following <hi>his own</hi> Expoſition or Sence thereof, or the Expoſition of a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> &amp;c.

That ſuch Precept be extended to all Communions whatever, as well thoſe private, or domeſtick, as, the publick (ſince in both poſſible to be obſerved) For there occurs nothing in our Lords words diſtinguiſhing theſe Communions, one from another: or ordering a receit of the Cup, in the one, which ſhall be left at liberty in the other: And ſo by ſuch ſence of Scripture, as we have ſaid, the practice of Antiquity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. 2. That it be extended, as to the receiving in <hi>both</hi> kinds, ſo to the receiving them <hi>apart,</hi> and to the drinking of the one, as the eating of the other: For the Scripture is no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs for the receiving of the blood, than it is, for receiving it ſeparated by it ſelf, and for drinking of it: By which the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Eaſtern Churches is condemned, who receive the Symbole of Chriſts <hi>Body</hi> only <hi>intinct</hi> in the <hi>Blood.</hi> 3.
